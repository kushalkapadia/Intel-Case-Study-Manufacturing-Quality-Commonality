# Intel-Case-Study-Manufacturing-Quality-Commonality
In Intel, a commonality is a common characteristic among a collection of lots/units. More specifically here, a commonality is a characteristic of the bad lots/units. The purpose of commonality analysis is to determine potenial causes for differences in process/station performance, yield, quality or reliability. 





Questions answered:

1] Graphical assessment of the defect percentage for each LOT_ID by UNIT_PROCESS_DATE to show the time trend. Indicate a time frame in which the problem occured. 

2] Determine which of the 13 parameters could be associated with the increase in defective units.

3] Other than these 13 parameters, are there any variables that can be associated with the increase in defective units?

4] [Bonus] From an analysis and data collection perspective, what methods of control could be implemented to detect such a problem while processing the units thereby preventing such an increase in defects?
